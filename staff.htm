            <h1>David Spahn</h1>
            <h2>Guitar, Keyboards, Composition</h2>
            <p>David Spahn started playing music at age 15 on a piano 
               that came into the household after his family moved to 
               Texas. David was fascinated with 
               the instrument and soon immersed himself in music. He 
               always had an interest in popular music and jazz, and 
               taught himself to play the guitar from the music theory 
               he learned at his piano lessons.
            </p>
            <p>David attended East Texas State as a music major, where 
               he studied theory and composition with acclaimed composer 
               William Turk. He also played and toured with the East 
               Texas State Jazz Ensemble. David has continued to 
               play and write music for a wide variety of styles, ranging 
               from contemporary Christian music to jazz fusion. He moved 
               back to Brownwood last year, and 
               when not teaching for Young Notes, he plays keyboard and 
               guitar for the musical group Southern Cross.

            teachers. Faculty teaching at the master level is also 
            available. Read their biographies in the box at the right.
